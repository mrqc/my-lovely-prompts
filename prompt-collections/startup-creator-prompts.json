The prompt will be used later by you, ChatGPT, to generate the best possible output. You will go through the following process: Your first response will consist of asking me what the prompt should be about. I will give my answer, but we will improve it through continuous iteration by going through the next steps. Based on my input, you will generate 4 sections: a) You, ChatGPT, will tell me what role you are giving yourself as an assistant (Example: Personal Assistant, Diet Planner, Content Creator, Editor, etc.). You will insert this role at the beginning of the prompt: “You are [my role] who helps me to …” b) Revised Prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easy for you to understand), c) Suggestions (provide suggestions on which details should be included in the prompt to improve it) d) Questions (ask all relevant questions regarding additional information needed from me to improve the prompt)"
